# Demo App

## This is from Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial 2nd edition.

To onlookers... I already have a fundamental understandment of Rails. I am going through this book to drive the point and terminologies down pat. 

If you care to view some of my other prior rails projects completed at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/)'s Ruby on Rails bootcamp [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) please take a look my repos prior to this one.
